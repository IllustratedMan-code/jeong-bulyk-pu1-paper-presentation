# eQTL signal doesn't colocalize with bQTLs

- Many significant bQTLs don't match an equivalent eQTL
- caQTLs do usually match with bQTLs
- Authors call it "mysterious"

---

# Study Guidelines for TF bQTLs

- High grade antibodies for ChIP-seq
- TF must be relevant to condition of interest
- Cell type must be relevant to the condition of interest

---

# Limitatations

- Low statistical power (few significat loci)
- These methods do not prove causality, only increase the likelyhood
- Genetic perturbation experiments need to be done to prove causality
