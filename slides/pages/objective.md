# Objective

<v-clicks>

- Some genetic variants can be associated with traits (i.e. GWAS)
- Understanding which variants "cause" the trait is difficult
- Determining the mechanism by which a variant causes a trait is difficult
- Need some way of associating a variant to a trait and also a functional phenotype (i.e. protein binding)

## Determine the functional cause of a trait/phenotype, given GWAS and PU.1 ChIP-seq + genotype data
